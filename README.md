# **React Native Bitcoin Wallet**


## Features

React Native Bitcoin Wallet exploits [bitcoinjs-lib](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib) to implement Bitcoin's JS bindings on mobile phone, using [react-native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) as a bridge between JS and native code. For a list of available features, please have a look at [bitcoinjs-lib features](https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib#features).
